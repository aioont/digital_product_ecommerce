What Is a Digital Product?
A digital product is any product you sell online that doesn’t have a physical form or substance. You can’t hold a website template in your hand, smell an e-book, or taste a software program — Uber eats does come close though ; ).

You can turn digital products into physical products. For instance, many people buy e-books in PDF format, then print them on their computers. The product becomes physical, but it started out in a digital format.
